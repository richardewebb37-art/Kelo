How to Install:
------------------

Double-Click the CCX-File to install the plugin. 
You should then see it under marketplace in your Creative Cloud Desktop Application.
Inside Photoshop, you can start the plugin via the menu (Plugins -> Shadowify 2) or by opening the plugins panel.


How to Use:
-------------------

## Create Shadows

1) Depending on what kind of shadow you want to create, open up the respective panel (dropshadow, flat shadows etc)
2) Select a layer
3) Click "Create Shadow" to generate the shadow
4) Change settings to your needs, the shadow will get updated immediately (shadow or original layer needs to be selected)

## Customize the Interface

You can hide sections and settings which you don't regularly use. 
Open up the flyout menu (menu icon at the top right of the panel) and use the "Customize ..." submenus.

----

## Apply Selective Blur

The Selective Blur panel works a bit differently than the rest. 
It has to calculate the blur from scratch for updates, so you'll have to undo (CTRL+Z) before each change.
Before applying it the first time, you need to set the blur origin ("where to blur away from"). 
It can be a selection, a specific layer or the upper layer.

## Saving Presets

Each panel provides the option to save your favorite settings as a preset.
Expand the "Presets" section and hit the save button. A popup will open, asking you for the preset's name.
Enter a name and hit save - the preset is now available from the presets dropdown.
In order to update a preset, do the same process and enter the current name of the preset.
